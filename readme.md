# Chortlin
This project intents to add a new solution to the world of service choreography. 
The report describing the language and the implementation will be available shortly. 

## Installing
Installing and trying out the Chortlin DSL is quite simple. 
Everything is built using mvn install. 
Currently no released version exists, but it is easy to built it and reference the project locally for testing. 
For an example of applying the implementation to a real world application please refer to https://github.com/Dickow/dtu-pay-example.
